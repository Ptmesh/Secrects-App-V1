# Secrets Website V1- Level 1 Authentication

Welcome to the Secrets Website - Level 1 Authentication project! This project showcases a simple authentication system using email and password verification. It's designed as a foundational level of security, serving as a starting point for learning and understanding authentication mechanisms.

## Overview

This web application allows users to register and log in securely to access "secrets". It is built using Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and PostgreSQL. The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate basic authentication implementation and database integration.

## Features

- User registration: Users can sign up with their email and password.
- User login: Registered users can log in to access the secrets page.
- Basic authentication: The system verifies user credentials before granting access.
- PostgreSQL integration: Utilizes a PostgreSQL database to store user information securely.

## Stack Used

- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for JavaScript.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **EJS**: Templating language for generating HTML markup.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Node.js and PostgreSQL installed.
3. Install project dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Set up your PostgreSQL database and update the connection details in the code.
5. Run the application using `npm start`.
6. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- Navigate to the homepage to register or log in.
- Upon successful login, you will be redirected to the secrets page.
- If you're not registered, sign up first to access the secrets.

## Future Improvements

This project serves as the foundation for future enhancements and learning opportunities. Potential improvements include:

- Implementing more robust authentication mechanisms like JWT or OAuth.
- Enhancing security measures such as password hashing and salting.
- Adding features like password recovery and email verification.
- Improving the user interface for a better user experience.
